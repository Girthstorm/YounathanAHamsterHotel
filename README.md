Hamster Hotel
Brief Description: I created a website about a hamster hotel based off of a figma.
Peer Reviewer: Joseph Poncini
Peer Review: Overall seems like a A grade. Here are some fixes that you can do in attempt to reach perfection
    Desktop Mode: In the desktop navbar (and tablet) the box around "Reserve" is meant to be on hover, not constant (I heard this from one of the TAs) In your css you can do something like nav-link:hover{ <!-- code in here for the box-->}  Aidan: Solved
    Tablet Mode: In your Packages section, you can position the hamsterwedding image to show the hamster Aidan: Fixed
    Mobile Mode: Your "Our Rooms" section is a little funky, maybe put in some padding so the cards won't go off? Aidan: solved at mobile large? Aidan: Fixed
    Overall though it's pretty good though dude!
